# RTGO
A re-implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend using Go. Has a few extra features like .obj loading, with more to come. Currently on the back-burner as I bring the CUDA version up to feature parity. Totally a hobby project, so no promises on documentation or support for now.
# Setup
## Ubuntu
- Install Go
- I had to apt install libgl1-mesa-dev for the obj loader to work

## Windows
- Install Go
